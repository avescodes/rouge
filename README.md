# Rouge

It's that falling block game, but in [Pedestal](http://pedestal.io)!

## Play it!

1. Launch a REPL with `lein repl`
2. `(start)`
3. Visit <http://localhost:3000/rouge-data-ui.html>
4. Win!

## Other stuff

I based this Pedestal version of that falling block game on a console version I
wrote. You'll find that version at
<https://github.com/rkneufeld/rouge/tree/console>.
